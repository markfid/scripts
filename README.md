# scripts
Random selection of bits and bobs. Initially created so that I had a sandbox to play with a hosted Git repo.

Intention is that these scripts can be used when a new VM of a certain flavour is spun up, I can then just run these scripts with a simple command to get my favourite bits and bobs installed:
```bash
sudo -H bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markfid/scripts/master/test.sh)"
```
